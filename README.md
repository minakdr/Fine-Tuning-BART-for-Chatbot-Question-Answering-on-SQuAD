# Fine-Tuning-BART-for-Chatbot-Question-Answering-on-SQuAD
This project centers on creating a high-performance question-answering chatbot by fine-tuning the BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) model on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD). The goal is to enable the chatbot to understand and respond accurately to user inquiries by developing deep contextual awareness through advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

The project begins with setting up the BART model architecture using the Hugging Face Transformers library, which provides a flexible framework for implementing and training complex language models. SQuAD, a dataset known for its challenging comprehension questions, is used to train the model on both questions and their corresponding answers from a range of topics. This dataset ensures that the chatbot learns to generate precise and contextually relevant responses, mimicking human-like comprehension.

The preprocessing phase involves cleaning, tokenizing, and structuring SQuAD data to fit BART’s input requirements. Specific attention is paid to handling text sequences to maintain context, as BART’s architecture combines encoder-decoder functions that require well-structured input data for optimal performance. Techniques such as padding, truncation, and special tokenization are applied to prepare the dataset.

During the training phase, various fine-tuning strategies are used to adjust BART’s parameters, improving the chatbot’s ability to answer questions accurately. This includes setting hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and optimization methods to avoid overfitting and enhance generalization. By leveraging transfer learning, BART is able to build on its pre-existing language comprehension, adapting it to the nuances of question-answering.

Once trained, the chatbot is evaluated using a set of performance metrics including accuracy, F1 score, and loss values on a validation subset of SQuAD. These metrics provide insights into the model’s precision, recall, and overall effectiveness in generating correct answers. 

The evaluation results are analyzed to identify areas for potential improvement, such as adjusting hyperparameters or applying additional regularization to enhance robustness.
